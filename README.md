# **TankAttack** #

**Please see Design/DESIGN.pdf for the implementation plan!**

**Built using Netbeans 8.0.2**

####First project for CompSci 308 Spring 2015####

**Name:** Ruslan Ardashev ('15)

**Date started:** 01/09/15

**Date finished:** 01/12/15

**Hours worked:** 16ish-hrs

**Resources used:** Google, Prof. Duvall's JavaFX Demo, Java API Documentation, Google, StackOverflow (comments in code where used)

**Main class file:** TankAttack

**Data (non Java) files needed:**
* a series of .png's that are included in the same directories as source code


**How to play the game:** UP,DOWN,LEFT,RIGHT to navigate. SPACE to shoot.

**Keys/Mouse input:** Mouse at Splash Screen, Keys elsewhere

**Cheat Keys:**
* "y" instantly progresses you to the next level (asynchronously). That means that while losing a round, you can press y, be taken to the main menu, then *continue* where you wanted to leave off!
* "i" grants unlimited health. HealthBar class is implemented to reflect this.


**Known bugs:**
* Asynchronous cheat code to advance to the next level.... not entirely sure if that would be considered a bug. This was unexpected at first but makes sense (it is an unfair cheat code, after all).

**Extra features:**
* A third level. This game was designed to be quickly and easily expandable. 
* A third type of enemy: EvilMinion, in addition to Minion (Level 1) and Boss (Level 2). These are parametrically, but not algorithmically different.

**Impressions/Suggestions:**
* Quick, fun, and easy assignment. If only the rest were like this....
